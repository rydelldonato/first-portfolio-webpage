                        <p>Hey there! My full name is Rydell Jordan Manto Donato. I'm 24 years old currently living in Sacramento, CA. A huge part of who I am derives from my past as an athlete and the journey post-athlete. The athlete life instilled core values that I live by every single day such as: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hard-work</li>
                            <li>Determination</li>
                            <li>Persistence</li>
                            <li>Understanding</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>I'm a person who won't settle for a life where I'm not doing something I genuinely enjoy.</strong></p>
                        <p>I use to believe that track and field was my future because it was what I enjoyed the most and made me the most happy. Due to an injury and some circumstances out of my control, I was faced with a tough decision where I ultimately let go of that one thing that I loved doing. The years that followed proved to be a challenge, but the values I carried with me helped me overcome all the mental, emotional, and physical hurdles. I learned to constantly seek to live by my core values in order to create a life I could look back at with no regret, knowing I did things I genuinly love.</p>

                        <p>Growing up with three siblings and cousins who are all around the same age was a lot of fun. A majority of our time together consisted of playing video games. Still today, we play video games together either online or during family get-togethers. I truly believe this sort of upbringing is what got me interested in tech, but I never thought to turn this amuse into a career until the beginning of 2022.</p>

                        <p>After my time as an athlete, I found myself with so much free time. I tried everything that peaked my interest. Even if it was just for a couple of months, I had to or I knew I'd regret it. One day, after experimenting with possible career paths from social media marketing to personal training, I just sort of stumbled upon a Youtube video about software engineering. As soon as I stepped foot in the learning process, the rest is history. I really believe my natural interest is what drives me to continuously learn more. While my core values along with my experience in sports team environments defintely helps me work well with others.</p>
